// This is a backup - the original schema had Portuguese table names
// User confirmed their actual database has:
// - Table names in ENGLISH: activities, leads, payments, profiles
// - Column names in PORTUGUESE: canal, status_atividade, qualificacao, etc.
// - Or possibly mixed English/Portuguese columns - need to test with actual data
